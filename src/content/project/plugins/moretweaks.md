## Usage
To use this plugin, simply download the latest release from Modrinth and upload it to your server's `plugins` folder and restart the server.

All tweaks and recipes are disabled by default so you will have to enable them in the `config.yml` file and restart the server or through the `/moretweaks` command in game.
